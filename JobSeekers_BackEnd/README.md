# JobSeekers - platform for freelancers to offer their skills to the world and users finding the perfect employee for their task

JobSeekers is an freelance application built on Angular and Spring as a project for the SoftUni Angular Course. It's purpose is to find your required person to do your task or to offer your help(work) to someone. Css code is written by me. Angular Material is used only for some components. Validation is included.

The application has three levels of accessibility: guest user, admin and registered user

This is the BackEnd part of the project.

## Run the application

Download the code from github, extract the zip file with WinRar or other PAID software. Run the code in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate. 

Configure your own database properties and dependencies in application.properties file. (MYSQL database is used)

Configure your own cloudinary properties and dependencies in application.properties file. (Cloudinary is used for image storage)
    
Start the BackEnd part so that the FrontEnd can communicate with the Rest controllers.

    Start it on http://localhost:8080
